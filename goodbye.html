Devotion turns one year old today, and for the time being, <br>
we are closing the chapter on Isa Obscura. <br><br>

Thank you so much for listening to our songs, supporting us live, <br>
and engaging with our art. It means the world to us, and <br>
we are so grateful for each of you. This experience of creating <br>
has been a pivotal moment in our lives, and has sparked a <br>
fire that will live forever. <br><br>

Dani and Justin will continue to make music as <a href="https://virgininatree.com" target="_blank" >Virgin in a Tree</a>. <br><br>
