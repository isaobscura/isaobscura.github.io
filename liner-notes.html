    Lyrics: <br> <br>
    <i>

It's killing me <br>
When you walked into the room <br>
It's eating me <br>
The way I want it to be you <br> <br>

Empty conversations to hold onto you <br>
Tell me can you read me <br>
The way I see straight through you <br> <br>

In love with potential <br>
Look past the noise <br>
Do I really love you <br>
Don't have a choice <br> <br>

It's killing me <br>
When you walked into the room <br>
It's eating me <br>
The way I wanted it to be you <br> <br>

In love with potential <br>
Drown out the noise <br> <br>

Pull down my skirt <br>
And tell me I'm pretty <br>
You're touching other girls <br>
Your beat up sneakers <br>
Beside her bed <br>
You live in my head <br> <br>

Bare and boned <br>
Strip me down <br>
Tell me all the things <br>
You don't talk about <br> <br>

It's killing me <br>
When you walked into the room <br>
It's eating me <br>
Her hands all over you <br> <br>

Its killing me <br> <br>

I'm passing all the signs <br>
I'm passing all the lights <br>
In love with potential <br>
With stars in my eyes <br> <br>

In love with potential <br> 
Drown out the noise <br> <br>

It's killing me <br> <br>

It's killing me <br> <br>

    <i>

        You're sleeping in again <br>
        Hope that it was me that you were dreaming <br> <br>
        
        I'll wait for you <br>
        If you meet me at the crossroads I'm torn between too <br> <br>
        
        Gripping <br>
        A little harder onto you <br> <br>
        
        Scared of losing myself <br>
        Like I always do <br> <br>
        
        It's you all l've been waiting for <br>
        Tell me what you've been waiting for <br> <br>
        
        You're a genius in my eyes <br>
        Obsessed with every part of you <br> <br>
        
        Don't you wanna be mine, mine <br>
        Let me in your mind, mind <br> <br>

    Lyrics: <br> <br>
    <i>
        Have you made up your mind yet <br> 
        Falling into you <br> 
        I'll do whatever you want to <br>
        Promise we'll stay the same <br> 
        Do whatever it takes <br> 
        Come up with whatever to say <br> 
        Would you wanna hear <br> <br> 

        Can you feel it <br> 
        Standing at the edge of the door <br> <br> 

        Can you hold it there <br> 
        We found it <br> 
        But baby could you go <br> 
        Without it <br> 
        And if you wanna know <br> 
        About me <br> 
        Then drink it all <br> 
        Surround me <br> <br> 

        Can you feel it <br> 
        Standing at the edge of the door <br> <br> 

        Can you feel it <br> <br> 

        Can you hold it there <br> 
        We found it <br>

    Lyrics: <br> <br>
    <i>
    Talk to me <br>
    Why are you leaving <br>
    You and I <br>
    Are forever fleeting <br> <br>

    I think the heat's getting to me <br>
    Start to replay all of our memories <br>
    I feel the heat's getting to me <br> <br>

    Nostalgia eats me up <br>
    Up <br> <br>

    It's been seven months <br>
    Since your mind has been made up <br>
    See you in supercuts <br>
    The floor keeps rising up <br>
    You start resenting me <br>
    For all I ever was <br> <br>

    Nostalgia eats me up <br>
    Up <br> <br>

    Up <br> <br>

    Talk to me <br>
    Why are you leaving <br>
    You and I <br>
    Are forever fleeting <br> <br>

    Talk to me <br>
    Why are you leaving <br> <br>
